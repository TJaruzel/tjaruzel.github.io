	<h1>Hi there, I'm Chris Judkins!</h1>
	<p>I'm a photographer, student, and gearhead. I'm currently studying Computer Science and I often use github for random projects I work on. </p>
	<ul><li>I host a teamspeak server using <a href=https://github.com/chrisjudk/stunning-octo-eureka>this</a> script to manage updates and server restarts.</li> 
	<li>I also work on <a href=https://github.com/chrisjudk/hosts>this</a> hosts file which I run at home on a raspberry pi to block ads.</li>
