            Welcome! Most people know me by my car, or one of them, my 1992 Mazda Miata that is heavily modified. Iâ€™m from Greenville, South Carolina and currently attending Augusta University for a degree in Computer Science. With this degree I would like to get into the networking and programming fields. After working in multiple corporations ranging from McDonalds, Kroger, Zaxbys, and Solvay Specialty Polymers, and even local businesses such as a transmission shop (RPM Transmissions) I have come to a realization that corporations implement advanced networks and computer systems. Yet, there is a lack of updated computerized systematic processes that run efficiently. Once you start to study digital logic design and get your hands-on coding in a few languages such as C# or Java, this becomes very apparent.

          <h3> About Me </h3>
        
          <p> 
            As seen above which has changed since the photo was taken years back, one of my hobbies is automobiles. Over the past four years I have been building this miata to learn about different areas of the car scene. Currently, the car has a forged engine I built at the age of 17 and is turbocharged. This results in a very fun light and great handling car that can leave a mustang in the dust when needed. There really are very few stock parts left on this car, and it even now lacks the wing above and has a black soft top. Not only have I built transmissions, at one of my previous workplaces (RPM Transmissions) I was an auto tech that did the repair and replace work. Eventually this lead to transmission dissasembly, and on came my interest in actually rebuilding the transmissions. I learned to build honda transmissions, and a handful of ford and chevrolet transmissions. Many of them are still roaming augusta currently. Technology experience implements nicely with auto work due to newer vechicles being so dependant on computers such as the PCM/ECM (Powertrain Control Module) or BCM (Body Control Module) and many more. While working at the shop I utilized scanners that costed thousands to communicate with the wide variety of vechicles we worked on.
